      The engine sends the Cartesian coordinates of a set of grid points. 
      This command is intended to be used in conjuction with the [<NDENSITY](NDENSITY) and [<DENSITY](DENSITY) commands; 
      these three commands enable a driver to acquire the electronic density distribution of an engine in a grid representation. 
      See the [<DENSITY](DENSITY) command for more details.
