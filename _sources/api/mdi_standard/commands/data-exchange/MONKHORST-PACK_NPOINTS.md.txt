# MONKHORST-PACK_NPOINTS



## >MONKHORST-PACK_NPOINTS
Send Monkhorst-Pack grid points

**Datatype:** `MDI_INT`  
**Quantity**: `3`  

 This command is typically expected for use with plane wave DFT engines.  The driver sends the engine the number of k-points to generate on a Monkhorst-Pack grid.  The engine then uses the k-points generated on this Monkhorst-Pack grid for all further simulations.
The number of k-points to generate along each vector of the Brillouin zone, in ascending order of vector.
