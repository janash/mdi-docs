# LABELS
Receive a label for each atom in the system.



## <LABELS

Receive atom labels.

**Datatype:** `MDI_CHAR`  
**Quantity**: `MDI_LABEL_LENGTH * NATOMS`  
**Format:** An array of characters corresponding to the label of each atom in ascending order of atomic index, with each label consisting of `MDI_LABEL_LENGTH` characters and being padded with spaces where necessary.

 The engine sends a label for each atom in its system.  "Labels" are intended primarily for the purpose of providing a human-readable identifier for each of the atoms,  and do not have a standardized physical meaning.  It is recommended that the labels correspond to the element of each atom (i.e., "H", "He", "Li", etc.),  a name associated with atoms of a particular type (i.e., "Carboxyl_Hydrogen", "Methyl_Hydrogen"),  or a similarly descriptive term.  The atom labels may correspond to a number identifier (i.e., "1", "2", "3", etc.) in cases where more descriptive labels are not practical,  but note that such labels must be represented using the MDI_CHAR data type, as indicated below.  It is required that atoms having different physical properties (i.e., different force field terms in a molecular mechanics simulation or different nuclear charges in a quantum chemistry simulation)  have different labels.
